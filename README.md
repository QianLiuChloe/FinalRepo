# Building Drawing Information Extraction and Estimation Tool

An automated tool developed to streamline the extraction of information and perform estimations from construction drawings in PDF format.

## Project Overview

This tool is designed to help users efficiently analyze and quantify data from architectural drawings, focusing on dimensions, quantities, and other essential metrics for construction components. It aims to enhance workflow efficiency, reduce manual errors, and provide accurate data for project cost management.

### Key Features
- **Drawing Conversion**: Splits multi-page PDF files into single-page PDFs and converts them to image format (JPG) for further processing.
- **Drawing Analysis**:
  - **Table Segmentation**: Detects table areas in drawings using YOLOv8 and separates tables for individual analysis.
  - **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from tables using PaddleOCR and exports results to Excel format.
  - **Component Dimension Parsing**: Parses dimensional data, calculates volumes, and updates the extracted table.
  - **Quantity Recognition**: Identifies and counts specific components (e.g., footings) using YOLO technology.
  - **Table Merging**: Combines extracted data and component counts into a final report table for comprehensive analysis.

## Installation Requirements
